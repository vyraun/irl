a. Get pointmass running on gym with TRPO.
1. Test ability of conv net to discriminate when point is different color (pathological case). Domain distinction
2. Test ability of velocity classifier to tell samples apart when there is no domain confusion present. Just good vs bad samples. Classifier
3. Test ability of classifier to distinguish even when domain confusion occurs.
4. Test this classifier signal as reward signal.
