Relationship between 3rd person RL and transfer/adaptation.

Adaptation is when we change the environment but not the essence of the task.
Transfer is when we change the essence of the task, and think that some previously solved task will prove useful.

The core problem in adaptation is to learn an encoding (the essence of the task) that can then be
utilized to complete the task across domains.
The core problem in transfer is to learn modules which can be called upon at the opportune moment to complete a task.

Adaptation is a subproblem of transfer? If transfer works perfectly, then it should be able to transfer accross domains.

Demo --> cost (domain invar disc) ---> policy

Demos --> cost (parameterized by basis)? ---> policy (parameterized by basis)
Demos ---> costs ---> policies ---> behavioral cloning
